# Hailsham's (un)official website

Short project for my AP Lit cressay on *Never Let Me Go* by Kazuo Ishiguro.

Artistic elements include a symbolic logo, a school seal, and a select Gallery artwork.

Access the website through Github Pages [here](https://crystaltine.github.io/hailsham_website/).

## Note
This is a very low quality project from a *web development* perspective. I limited my effort on this because I get sucked into the design black hole *way* too easily and did not want to spend hours upon hours polishing up a website that wouldn't even be the main creative aspect (my artwork is).

For those who are wondering, yes, I know the code is an absolute mess, but keep in mind this is an ENGLISH project and intended for nothing more.
